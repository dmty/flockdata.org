# FD CONTENT Handling
# Content profile tells us how to transform data

# using a path means we will look for a file name matching the step name
# i.e. the above can be resolved as
#fd.content.path=/profiles
#steps in your job should be named as "fortress.doctype" i.e. time.staff
# which would look for a file called /profiles/time/staff.json
